### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Sagun Pandit and I am a rising CS junior at University of Illinois -Springfield. I enjoy solving algorithmic problems and optimizing space-time complexities. I mainly do my object oriented programming and development with Java, but I also use Python for my machine learning projects. I am also currently looking for opportunities in either of those fields. You can reach out to me at https://twitter.com/sagun_pandit and https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagun-pandit-2a3ba2206/.
